I was reintroduced to it in 2023 when pairing with Jerome Lecomte on one of his projects. I was blown away by how clear and readable the syntax was! This feels like building simple webpages before we complicated them with all these heavyweight frameworks. The compiler for Svelte is doing a lot of heavy lifting here, but it's truly worth it.
